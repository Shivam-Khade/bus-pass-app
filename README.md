📌 Problem Statement
  
The existing bus pass system of PMPML currently provides only a daily pass facility, lacking flexible options such as monthly, quarterly, and yearly passes. This limitation reduces convenience for regular commuters like students and employees who require long-term travel solutions.

Additionally, the current system does not include any emergency or safety mechanism for passengers. There is no integrated SOS feature that allows users to request immediate assistance during emergencies.

To address these gaps, this project introduces:

📅 Multiple pass options (Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly) to provide flexible and cost-effective travel solutions for regular commuters.

🆘 Integrated SOS alert system with real-time location coordinates, enabling passengers to request immediate assistance during emergencies.

💳 Secure digital payment simulation to streamline the pass purchasing process in a safe and efficient manner.

📲 QR-based digital pass verification for quick, contactless, and tamper-proof validation.

This solution enhances flexibility, safety, and digital accessibility compared to the existing system.
